The m5.large is a general purpose instance with fixed CPU and memory. The t3.large instance provides the same vCPU and memory capacity but uses a burstable CPU model, which is more cost-effective for workloads with moderate CPU usage and occasional spikes. Given the CPU utilization pattern, t3.large can handle the workload while reducing cost by approximately 50%. The workload is production, but the risk is low because t3.large supports unlimited bursting and the memory footprint is unchanged. Network throughput and storage are not bottlenecks here.",
